// //2a
// console.log(number1);
// var number1 = 3;

// var number2 = 2.9;
// var number3 = 0xff;

// var firstName = "Eyad";
// var middleName = 'Osama';
// var lastName = `Ibrahim`; 
// //2b
// var flag = true;
// //2c
// console.log("This is the External JavaScript file");

//3a => because variables declared by var are hoisted so it means that var number1; was created before the console.log(number1);

//3b because external.js wasn't loaded before the internal script so the variable was not created yet

//3c the variable already declared in the external.js file after the second internal script
